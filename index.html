<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Victor Rubio. I am currenly attending Cerritos College to get my Asscoiates Degree and transfer to CSULB. I am currenlty majoring in Systems Analyst. I was studing child development but decided to try something new as working with computers was one of my first passions. I have always been into computers since I was little and would help family members out when they needed help with fixing their computers. </p>
